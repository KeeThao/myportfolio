                <div><h3>Coding bootcamp can intimidate people. The 'bootcamp' part can scare people off. Before undertaking this endevor I did alot of research into whether I should go through with it or not. Alot of reviews I read were horror stories of how lackluster and poor planning the bootcamp was and how horrible the teachers were. My experience differ greatly. Much of what they say were true. The amount of homework can be ovewhelming and the pacing of the curiculum can be daunting, but the instructor was amazing. Perhaps I got lucky? I don't know.</h3></div> 

                <div><h3>The amount I had to learn in order to do the assignments left me second guessing myself, but that was to be expected, it is called bootcamp after all. It was hard but not impossible. In hindsight after finishing bootcamp, I am glad I went through with it. Bootcamp opened my eyes to how little I know about technology and allowed me to expand my understanding of the world wide web. It made me realized how marvelous of a creation the web was. I went into this program hoping to learn how to makes websites and get a better job, but I came out learning so much more. For example, I had very little understanding of what github and APIs were or of what wireframing and Agile was. Now I can tell you extensively of what those terms are and how important they are to would-be programers. For those who doubt taking a coding boot camp would prep them for getting a job or make them be a better programmer, my personal belief is that it will. If you want to challenge yourself and grow as a programmer, you should take go through a coding bootcamp. Like my admissions advisor, Gary Feuer said, "Kee, You get what you put in." I'll tell you likewise. You get what you put in. Here are the results of what i put in.The fruits of my labor. Feel free to peruse at your leisure.</h3></div>
